# UnalSpaceInvaders
This repository has its own version of space invaders inspired by the systems engineering degree at the National University of Colombia.

## Serve the game

To serve the game, install *http-server* with **Nodejs** and **NPM** with the following command:

```bash
npm install -g http-server
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
http-server
```

Finally, open the browser and go to the following URL:

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8080/unalSpaceInvaders.html
```

If you're using **NPM 5.2.0** or higher, you can use the following command without installing *http-server* globally:

```bash
npx http-server
```
